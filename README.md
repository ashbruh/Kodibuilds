# Kodibuilds
This repository is mainly for me to store kodi builds that I've created.
To install these builds I've created, simply download and unzip it, then replace the addon and userdata folders in the kodi filesystem with the ones in the zip file.
To download my builds visit https://mega.nz/folder/QWVgASrY#iqYqYQ3guPu1lbgfDUCR3w
